# Reflection Questions

Answer these as you go — don't wait until the end. Some answers only exist
*after* you've done a step, so fill this in progressively.

Your answers will be reviewed alongside your code. Generic or copy-pasted
answers (that don't reference your actual output) will be sent back for
revision.

## Part 4 — After hitting the seeded merge conflict

**6. What caused the conflict? Which file and lines were involved?**

> Your answer here.
The conflict was caused because both branches added a contributor in the same location in CONTRIBUTORS.md. The conflicting lines were the contributor entries for Sarah Ahmed and Mohammed Nasser.

**7. How did you resolve it — what did you keep, remove, or combine, and why?**

> Your answer here.
I kept both contributor entries and removed the Git conflict markers. I kept both because both contributors should remain in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file.
